           ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

           Let's  talk  about DemoVT.  It's a program that is capable of
        playing  a  MOD  music while another program is running.  If you
        know  what  the  ShellVT  program  is,  then  the  DemoVT  is  a
        "slightly"  modified  version.  Its  primary use is intended for
        graphics demonstrations (demos)  and games, but it could be used
        for  other  kinds  of  applications.   It  should  work  on  286
        machines, but it has only been tried on 386SX and above.

           It  is  NOT a TSR program.  Instead,  when it is run it loads
        the  music  file  and  then executes another program via the DOS
        EXEC  function.  When  the  executed program terminates,  DemoVT
        terminates also (more on this later).

           It  is NOT a stand alone background modplayer.  It requires a
        minimal  (and allows a maximal)  collaboration with the executed
        program.  ShellVT  is  a great stand alone choice if that's what
        you want ;-)

         DEMOVT   test.mod  /f:20000  /d:DMA-SB-Mono  /port:$220  /irq:7
        /dma:1 /v:74 /sh:test1.exe

           The  above (it should have been just one line)  is an example
        of  how to play the TEST.MOD file through the Sound Blaster card
        at  220-7-1,  at  a  sample rate of 20000 Hz and a volume of 74,
        while running the TEST1.EXE program.

           Sample  rates  range  from  4000  to  44100  Hz (it won't get
        higher than your card allows). Possible devices are:

         Silence       - No sound. Quiet. interprets the music anyway.
         DMA-SB-Mono   - Any Sound Blaster in mono. Also PAS cards.
         DMA-SB-Stereo - SB Pro and SB 16 in stereo.
         GUS           - Gravis Ultrasound. Fixed rate of 44100 Hz.

           Port,  IRQ  and  DMA range to any available to your favourite
        card.  You  don't  want  us  to list all different possibilities
        here,  do you?  Volumes are from 0 to 127. The /sh: program file
        should have the file extension and the path if necessary.

           In  'silence'  mode, DemoVT will use a serial port for timing
        (this  lets  you  use  the  timer 0 for your own purposes).  Any
        serial  port  is  useable,  but it will use COM1 by default.  To
        change it, just use the /port: and /irq: options:

                  COM1 - /d:Silence /port:$3F8 /irq:4
                  COM2 - /d:Silence /port:$2F8 /irq:3
                  COM3 - /d:Silence /port:$3E8 /irq:4
                  COM4 - /d:Silence /port:$2E8 /irq:3

           IRQ  values  for  COM3  and  COM4  are usually changed to any
        other.  COM2  to COM4 may be absent,  but DemoVT will not detect
        this and will hang.



           DemoVT script files
           ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

           Above  we said that DemoVT finishes when the executed program
        terminates.  That's not completely true.  In fact, it's possible
        to  keep  the DemoVT running after that.  How?  Using scripts to
        make  the  DemoVT  load  a  (possibly)  different MOD and/or run
        another  (possibly)  different  program.  If  you  did  this  by
        executing   repeatedly   DemoVT,   the   sound  card  would  get
        initialised each time, thus making an awful click.

           Create a text file with this:

         ; -------------- Start of TEST.VTO --------------------

         /f:44100         ; 44100 Hz
         /d:DMA-SB-Stereo ; Stereo Sound Blaster.
         /port:$220       ; Sound Blaster Port.
         /irq:7           ; Sound Blaster IRQ.
         /dma:1           ; Sound Blaster DMA.
         /v:127           ; Sound volume.

                 test1.mod /sh:test1.exe    ; 1st MOD & 1st program.
         / /v:74 test2.mod /sh:test2.exe    ; 2nd MOD & 2nd program.
                                            ; Volume of 127

         ; --------------- End of TEST.VTO ---------------------

           Note  the  "/"  at the start of the second MOD/Program.  It's
        required  to  make  the first ones to be executed.  It separates
        the  different  execution  lines.  Also,  it's important to make
        /sh:  the  last  switch in the line.  You can add a full command
        line  to  the  program  if  you  want.  And  you  can really add
        comments starting with ";".

           The above script would be used executing:

         DEMOVT @test.vto

           For  those  of  you  who have seen it,  the Inconexia Demo by
        Iguana  generates  a  script  like  the above,  bigger,  with an
        executable file for each part.

           If you want to run several programs under a unique MOD,  like
        different  parts  of  a trackmo,  just specify the MOD file only
        with  the first executable.  As an example,  here's included the
        VTO that runs the whole Inconexia demo:

         ; --------------- End of INCONEXI.VTO ---------------------

         /d:gus        ; Use the Gravis Ultrasound.
         /port:$240    ; GUS Port.
         /irq:11       ; GUS Irq.
         /v:80         ; Initial volume.

           inconexi.003        /sh:inconexi.004
         / inconexi.005        /sh:inconexi.006
         / inconexi.008        /sh:inconexi.009
         /                     /sh:inconexi.010
         /                     /sh:inconexi.011
         /                     /sh:inconexi.012
         /                     /sh:inconexi.013
         / inconexi.014 /v:128 /sh:inconexi.015

         ; --------------- End of INCONEXI.VTO ---------------------



           Advanced options
           ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

           To  play  the  MOD  from  a different sequence position (i.e.
        14),  use  the  following switch: /ss:14 Also,  use the switches
        /sl:22  and  /sr:18  to load only the sequence up to position 22
        and to repeat from position 18.  All values range from 1 to 128.
        Experiment with this.

           If  you  want  to  have  the  MOD file stored inside a bigger
        file,  you  can  use the switch /off:193847.  This will load the
        MOD from position 193847 in the file. Also, experiment with it.



           Synchronisation
           ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

           This  is  the big thing in DemoVT that makes it very special.
        It's  also  very tricky,  so we advice you to read all this very
        carefully  and  look  into  the  examples.  And,  of course,  to
        experiment a lot with it.

           The  first  thing  to  talk  about is the delay.  When DemoVT
        interprets  the MOD's partiture,  it does it half a second ahead
        of  the  sound  it  generates.  The important thing is to always
        remember  this  delay  when interacting with the music (changing
        the  volume or jumping in the partiture).  DemoVT will hide this
        delay  when  it tells you about its state,  but you will have to
        keep it in mind when you try to alter DemoVT's state.

           The first way to synchronize is using semaphores.  There's an
        array  of 256 semaphores; each of them gets incremented whenever
        a  command  number  8  is  found in any channel of the MOD.  The
        parameter  of this command tells which one of the 256 semaphores
        gets  incremented.  Your program can check any semaphore anytime
        for  a  given  value,  to  see if the music has passed through a
        point in the partiture.  When DemoVT is started,  all semaphores
        are set to zero.

           The  second  way to synchronize is using precise timing.  The
        DemoVT  provides  you  with  a  counter that gets incremented 50
        times  per  second,  and  which is also used for the MOD timing.
        You  can  read  it  and therefore know exactly how much time has
        passed  since  the  music started.  DemoVT also lets you control
        exactly  when  does  the  music start.  In fact,  DemoVT doesn't
        start playing until you explicitly tell.



           Modes of operation
           ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

           DemoVT  can  operate in Poll Mode or Timer Mode.  When DemoVT
        starts it is in Poll Mode. Read below for more information.



           Ok! What else?
           ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

           Now  that I've got you interested,  I'll tell you a couple of
        things.

           This is what I expect from you:

           First,  if  you  use  this,  you  MUST  credit  me:  JCAB  of
        VangeliSTeam/Iguana.

           Second,   if   you   have   used  DemoVT  for  non-profitable
        non-commercial purposes,  please contact me at the address below
        and  tell  me  what  you  used  it for,  and how you did it.  If
        possible,  send  me  a  copy of the program or whatever you have
        made  using  the  DemoVT.   You'll  be  sent  greetings  in  the
        following releases.

           Third,  if  you're  going  to  use it for a commercial and/or
        profitable  purpose,  you must first contact me to get a written
        permission.

           You  could  also  use  it  without  paying,   contacting  nor
        crediting me. If you do so then fuck you.

           If   you  find  this  program  worth  it,   you  can  send  a
        contribution  of  $10,  or  anything  you  feel is fair,  to the
        address below.

           You  are  also encouraged to send any comments about anything
        you  want  concerning  the  program  and/or  documentation,   or
        questions about your particular use of DemoVT.  Please,  enclose
        a self-addressed,  stamped envelope if you expect an answer.  It
        would be very encouraging to receive feedback about my work.

           Technical information
           ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

           This  program  is  heavily based on the Public Domain utility
        called VangeliSTracker,  also made by me. The last version up to
        date of VangeliSTracker is 1.39,  and its source code is also in
        the  Public  Domain,  so you can find many technical insights of
        DemoVT in it.

           When  using the Silence  "output device",  the timing is done
        by using the COM1 serial port and IRQ 4.  It might have problems
        with some mouse drivers.  I know it's wicked, but that's the way
        it's made.

           When  using  sound output through the GUS card,  the internal
        timers   of   this  card  are  used,   and  the  partiture  gets
        interpreted  only  through  interrupts.  Anyway,  the  Timer and
        Polled modes are emulated.  No DMA is used.  The instrument data
        is  kept  in  the  card's  memory.  It's  up to you to make sure
        there's enough of that memory.

           When  using  Sound Blaster,  the DMA provides the timing.  It
        also  takes  up more memory because of the DMA buffers involved,
        and  the  instruments of the MOD are kept in main memory and UMB
        memory.

           In  Timer  mode,  only  INT  1Ch (must be called a minimum of
        12.5  times per second)  is used,  and the timer hardware is not
        reprogrammed.



           Libraries provided
           ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

           The  DemoVT  is designed to be used through a few routines we
        provide  in  the  libraries.  They  are  provided  for Real Mode
        Assembler,  PMode Assembler (Tran's PMode),  Turbo Pascal,  Real
        Mode C and DPMI (Watcom) C.

           Here  you  can  find the descriptions of those routines.  The
        names  used are those of the assembler interface.  To know about
        the  other  interfaces  (C  and  PAS),  please,  look  into  the
        interface source code and into the examples provided.

        -------------------------------- InitMusic
           Call this if you want to mess with the DemoVT.  I suppose you
        want  to.  It detects whether DemoVT is present (DL = 1)  or not
        (DL = 0), and initalizes the above pointers.

        -------------------------------- CallMusic
           Calls the player when in polled mode.  This means that if you
        want  to  use the timer (IRQ 0)  for your application,  you must
        manually  call  the  DemoVT  so that it will play the partiture.
        This  routine must be called at least at a 50Hz average rate; if
        you  don't,  the music will jump.  You can call it several times
        before  making  a  long  process;  experiment how many times you
        need to avoid jumps.

        -------------------------------- VTConnectTimer
           Turn  on timer mode.  In this mode the player uses the system
        timer  to  perform its task,  so you don't need to manually call
        InitMusic.  But  you  also  can't use the timer for you.  Please
        don't   hook   to  the  IRQ0  and  then  call  the  old  handler
        (DemoVT's), if you want to do such a thing use the polled mode.

        -------------------------------- VTDisconnectTimer
           Enter  polled  mode.  From  now  on,  make  frequent calls to
        CallMusic,  and  feel  free  to do what you desire with the IRQ0
        timer.

        -------------------------------- VTGetTickCounter
           Reads  the  internal  50Hz  counter of the DemoVT into DX:AX.
        Use  this to synchronize with the music in terms of time played.
        (For  synchronization  you can also use the semaphores described
        later.)

        -------------------------------- VTBeginSync
           Performs   the   usual  preparations  for  calling  the  next
        routines.  Call  this when you want to be a bit in sync with the
        music.  If you just want a background music you won't need this,
        but I'd advise you to call it anyway  'cause I'm not sure of the
        behaviour (I ALWAYS call it).

        -------------------------------- VTWaitForStart
           Performs  a half-second wait and initializes the tick counter
        to  zero.  In  the  DemoVT,  the music always goes half a second
        behind  the  partiture; this means that,  for example,  a volume
        change  will  take  effect  that  half  second  later.  Use this
        routine  to  prepare  yourself  for  that change.  Another place
        where  you  will  want  to  use  this is at the start of a song.
        Right  after  calling VTBeginSync,  there will be no music; call
        VTWaitForStart,  and  it  will return at the precise moment when
        the first note of the song is starting to fill your ears.

        -------------------------------- VTJumpPos
           Jump to some precise pattern in the sequence (AH)  , and to a
        note  inside  that  pattern  (AL).  Both  values range from 1 to
        whatever.  Remeber  this,  FastTracker musicians!  The jump will
        take effect half a second after you call this.

        -------------------------------- VTCheckSemaphore
           Compares  AL  with  the  value of the semaphore number  'BX'.
        Sempahore  values  are incremented by a special command embedded
        in  the  MOD:  Command  number 8.  The parameter of this command
        gives the number of the semaphore to increment.

        -------------------------------- VTSetSemaphore
           Sets the value of the semaphore # BX to the value AL.  You'll
        find  this  useful  to  clear the value of a semaphore that gets
        set  by  a  command  in  a  pattern  that repeats several times.
        Huuhh... when you need this you will know, I guess.

        -------------------------------- VTMiddleSync
           Checks if the sempahore # BX is set.  If not, it jumps to the
        position DH,  DL (pattern,  note)  in the MOD.  In any case,  it
        waits  for  the  next  semaphore (BX +1)  to activate and exists
        without jumping.
           You can use this to set precise synchronization points.  When
        you want to get to one (for example,  when starting some part of
        a trackmo),  you want to wait for that time to come, or get back
        to  it  if  it  already  passed  (by  some  slow disk reading or
        something  like  that).  We used this to allow you to skip parts
        of  the Inconexia trackmo and keep the music synchronized.  It's
        hard  to explain; read the above description and keep it in mind
        when you need something like this.

        -------------------------------- VTSetSoundVolume
           Changes  the sound's volume to AL.  It will really change 1/2
        second after this call.  You don't have to worry about the delay
        when  you  use  this to fade the music.  Just wait half a second
        after you finish fading.

        -------------------------------- VTGetSoundVolume
           Reads  the  sound's  volume into AL.  Fairly straightforward,
        ain't it?

           If  you  are  so  nice  that  you refuse to use our wonderful
        library,  then  you can try to access the DemoVT directly.  Good
        luck.

           To  access the DemoVT from your program,  you must first call
        the  Multiplex Interrupt DOS service (INT 2Fh).  The appropriate
        setup calling sequence in assembler is the following:

                   MagicAX    = 5654h;  {'VT'}
                   MagicBX    = 5472h;  {'Tr'}
                   MagicCX    = 6163h;  {'ac'}
                   MagicXorBX = 6B65h;  {'ke'}
                   MagicXorCX = 7220h;  {'r '}

                   XOR     DL,DL

                   INC     DL
           @@no:

           After this,  register DL will contain a 1 if the DemoVT is in
        fact  installed,  or  a  0  if  it  is  not.  If  the  DemoVT is
        installed,  then ES:DI will contain a far pointer to a character
        string  in  Pascal  format  (length  byte first)  describing the
        DemoVT program and version.  Also, in ES:[DI-4] is a far pointer
        to  a  data  structure that contains adittional data.  Here is a
        description of the data found under this pointer:

           Variable descriptions are as follows:

         ==========
         Semaphores
         ==========

           Everytime  DemoVT  finds  a  command  8  in the MOD file,  it
        increments  one of the bytes in this variable.  The parameter of
        the command says which of the bytes is incremented.  You can use
        the  semaphores  to  synchronize your program to the music being
        played. For more information, see the chapter "Synchronisation".

         =========
         ChansTrig
         =========

           Those  variables  are  set  to  1  when the corresponding MOD
        channel retriggers a note.  You should set it to 0 when you read
        it.  With this, you can implement channel non-volume bars. It is
        updated with the real sound, not the half a second delay.

         ===========
         NumChannels
         ===========

           This is the number of channels that the MOD contains.

         ==============
         CtrlEntryPoint
         ==============

           This   variable  contains  a  pointer  to  the  routine  that
        provides  the DemoVT services.  Service number must be pushed on
        the  stack,  and none of the services requires parameters.  This
        routine  can  be  called directly from Turbo Pascal.  If you are
        using  the  C  language,  then  you must declare this routine as
        "FAR PASCAL".

           Service numbers are:

           Service  0: Start Timer mode,  using the system timer.  After
        calling this routine,  music keeps running automaticly. You must
        use  this  when  you're  not  sure  if  you will be able to call
        service 2 often enough (i.e.  when reading files using DOS's INT
        21h).

           Service  1: Start Poll mode.  Just the opposite of service 0.
        DemoVT always starts in Poll mode.  Poll mode is a better choice
        when  you  need  a fine timing and/or need to synchronize to the
        video retrace, which mostly happens in demos and games.

           Service  2: Call the song routine when in Poll mode.  Must be
        called more than 50 times per second,  unless you're using Timer
        mode (service 0). This keeps the music running.

           Service  3:  Begin  synchronization.  You  should  call  this
        before  the  music starts playing.  It resets everything to make
        it  an  exact  half a second wait before the sound starts coming
        out.

         ===========
         TickCounter
         ===========

           This  variable  gets  incremented  by  DemoVT  50  times  per
        second.  It's  intended for you,  to get a steady timing method,
        so you can synchronize correctly with the music.

         =============
         RegEntryPoint
         =============

           This  is the same as the CtrlEntryPoint above,  only that the
        service  number is given in the AX register.  This is needed for
        DPMI interfaces.

         =========
         ChansData
         =========

           This  gives information on the period (the note),  the volume
        and the instrument being played on each channel.

         ====
         Note
         Seq
         ====

           This  tells  you  the  current position/note in the partiture
        that is being played right now.

           Sequence  positions  and  notes are always 1-based in DemoVT.
        Sequence ranges from 1 to 128 and notes from 1 to 64.

         ===========
         JumpNewPos
         JumpPosSeq
         JumpPosNote
         ===========

           Those three variables are used to jump in the music.  You are
        supposed  to  know  that MOD music is made out of patterns of 64
        notes  each,  and  that  patterns  are arranged in a sequence of
        pattern numbers.  Well, maybe you use different names for those,
        but  you'll  understand.  To force a jump in the music,  you put
        the  desired  sequence position in JumpPosSeq,  the desired note
        of the pattern in JumpPosNote,  and then a 1 in JumpNewPos.  The
        music  will  automaticly  jump  to  that position (well,  half a
        second later ;-D).

           Sequence  positions  and  notes are always 1-based in DemoVT.
        Sequence ranges from 1 to 128 and notes from 1 to 64.

         ===========
         SoundVolume
         ===========

           You  can change this to whatever volume you want the music to
        use.  It  ranges  from  0 to 255,  and the default volume is 255
        (maximum).  This  does  not  correspond to the /v: switch of the
        DemoVT program.  Sound volume ALWAYS ranges from 0 to 255,  with
        255  corresponding  to  the  /v:  volume.  This change will take
        effect half a second later.

         =====
         Abort
         =====

           Set  this  to  1 if you want DemoVT to exit to DOS as soon as
        your  program does,  without playing any more MODs nor executing
        any more programs.

           This is used to abort a demo when the user presses ESC.

         =========
         reservedX
         =========

           Those  are unused variables.  Don't mangle with them or maybe
        your  wonderful  program  won't  work  with  future  versions of
        DemoVT that support MegaBlasterSuperUltraSound WOWWHATCARD.
